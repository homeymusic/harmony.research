# from Leonhard Euler’s Tentamen Novae Theoriae Musicae:
#      A Translation and Commentary
#      by Charles Samuel Smith
#
# p. 103 Chapter IV sec 6
# "Henceforth the term exponent will be used to designate the least common
# multiple of the simple sounds composing a consonance. With this designation
# the nature of the consonance itself is ascertained at once. In section 27,
# Chapter II, a method was described for finding the degree of agreeableness
# from the given exponent. The formula may be expressed by s-n+1, where s is
# the sum of the prime factors of the exponent and n is the number of these
# factors. The smaller the number yielded by this formula, the more agreeable
# or more easily perceived is the consonance under consideration."
#
# Vogel p. 148 adjust the -n+1 so "every 3,5,7 ... is taken fully in account".
#
# Euler p. 79 starts with least common multiple 1:2^n 1 is always in numerator
# for Euler the unision 1:1 = 1 + 1 - 2 + 1 = 1
# the perfect fifth 3:2 would be expressed as 1:6, n=2 3+2-2+1=4
# and the major 3rd 5:4 would be 1:20 2+2+5 = 9, n = 3 with -n+1 = 7
# for the major triad we would combine 3:2 with 5:4
# but to find common ground we need a 5 or a 4
# so we multiply 3:2 by 2 to give us 6:4 and then combine 6:4:5:4 -> 4:5:6
# so the major triad would be 1:60 n=4 2+2+3+5-4+1 = 9
#
# we start with ratios() expressed as prime factor exponents = product(p^n_p)
# ratio = 1^n_1 * 2^n_2 * 3^n_3 * 5^n_5
# where n_p is positive for numerator and negative for denominator
# see examples here: https://enxen.wiki/w/Monzo
#
# our dissonance measure is the sum of those sum(p*n_p) exponent prime factors
# dissonance = 1*n_1 + 2*n_2 + 3*n_3 + 5*n_5
# this ends up being almost the sum of the prime factors the only difference is
# that because any number raised to 0 is 1
# that means 1^0 = 1 for the ratio and so n_1 = 0 and so 1*n_1 = 0
#
# for us the perfect fifth is 3:2 = 5
# unison 1:1 = 0
# octave 2:1 = 2
# perfect fifth 3:2 = 5
# major 3rd 5:4 = 9
# and the major triad would 5:4:3:2 and we just sum up the exponent prime factors
#
#
# Euler:    1,11, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8.5, 4, 8, 7,  9, 10, 2
# Vogel:    1,12, 9, 9, 7, 5, 9.5, 4, 8, 8, 10, 11, 2
# Current:  0,16,12,10, 9, 7,  13, 5,11, 8, 14, 14, 2
#
# the results are similar but one interesting distinction is that
# the difference between the octave complements in the current measure
# is 2 which is the formula for the octave complement ri*r2=2
# whereas for Euler and Vogel the differences in octave complements is 1
