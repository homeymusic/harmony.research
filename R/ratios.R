# ah the tritone, what a pain
#
# each octave complement is symmetrical wrt to ratios and distance in cents
# ideally we would have two tritones or use the ET tritone of 600 cents, sqrt(2)
# but to keep the code cleaner we ought to choose a tritone with the smallest
# prime factors but close enough to 600 cents so that it is below human perception.
#
# best choice with that rationale would be 17/12 and 24/17, 3.000 cents from 600
# however the consonance measure is poor that it doesn't agree with any published
# experimental data that we could find cf. Bowling, Plomp and Levitt and others.
#
# The tritone that seems to best match the research is 7/5 however its
# a full 17.488 cents from 600 which means it's 3x perceptibly different from
# the ET tritone.
#
# alas, given two bad choices we choose to match the empirical data.
